# 5e Initiative Tracker
Simple tracking web-app designed to help Dungeon Masters keep track of turn order and status effects such as poison, bleeding, etc. 

Designed primarily for DnD 5th edition, but should work with pretty much any tabletop game.

This project was never finished, since I eventually found several other solutions to the problem I was trying to solve. The code is left up for posterity.
